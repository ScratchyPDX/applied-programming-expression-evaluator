# Overview
This program reads a math expression from a user input prompt, evaluates it, and prints the result. It is capable of intepreting equations that include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents (using the ^ character).

# Development Environment
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some of the capabilities of C++. Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (17.9) was used to code, test, and debug this project. The project was written in C++ 14 Standard, which is the default for Visual Studio 2022.

## The project use headers which perform the following functions:
[**\<iostream\>**](https://cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/) - Header that defines the standard input/output stream objects

[**\<string\>**](https://cplusplus.com/reference/string/) - This header introduces string types, character traits and a set of converting function

[**\<stack\>**](https://cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/) - Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.

[**\<cmath\>**](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/?kw=cmath) - Declares a set of functions to compute common mathematical operations and transformations

[**\<vector\>**](https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/)  Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size

[**\<sstream\>**](https://cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/) Header providing string stream classes

[**\<conio\>**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59812090) Deprecated library that contains routines that are specific to the DOS command line
